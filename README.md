# take-my-file

Over-simplistic file sharing server for local network.

There are only some of cool features it doesn't have:

- Authorization
- Configuration
- File preview
- Download limits
- Link sharing

It just shows a list of files and allows to download one.

Actually, it's generated by AI in two minutes after I gave up fighting samba in the mixed Windows-Linux home local network.
